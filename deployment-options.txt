# DFitness Planet - Deployment Guide
This document outlines the two methods for deploying the DFitness application while retaining the local SQLite database.

## Option 1: Local Gym Network Deployment (Free & Easy)

**Best for:** Using the app on a tablet/PC only while physically inside the gym, connected to the gym's Wi-Fi.

**Prerequisites:**
1. A PC or Laptop at the gym reception that stays turned on during business hours.
2. The PC must be connected to the gym's Wi-Fi network.

**Steps:**
1. Open the command terminal on the gym PC.
2. Navigate to the project folder (`d:\Dfitness`).
3. Run the command: `npm run build` (You only need to do this once whenever code changes).
4. Run the command: `npm run start` (This starts the production server).
5. Find the gym PC's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.15`). You can find this by typing `ipconfig` in the Windows command prompt and looking for the IPv4 Address.

**How to Use:**
- On the gym PC: Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
- On the gym tablet/phone (connected to the same Wi-Fi): Open a browser and go to `http://192.168.1.15:3000` (Replace with the actual IP address found in Step 5).

## Option 2: VPS Cloud Deployment (Accessible Anywhere)

**Best for:** Accessing the admin dashboard from home, on mobile data, or anywhere in the world. Requires setting up a Virtual Private Server (Linux).

**Prerequisites:**
1. Rent a cheap/free Linux server (VPS).
   - Free options: Oracle Cloud "Always Free" ARM instance.
   - Cheap options ($4-$6/mo): DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS Lightsail, Hetzner.

**Steps (on the Linux Server):**
1. Connect to your VPS via SSH.
2. Install Node.js (v18+) and Git.
3. Clone your GitHub repository containing the DFitness code.
4. Navigate into the cloned folder.
5. Install dependencies: `npm install`
6. Generate the Prisma database client: `npx prisma generate`
7. Run the database migrations (if necessary): `npx prisma db push`
8. Build the application: `npm run build`
9. Install PM2 globally to keep the app running in the background: `npm install -g pm2`
10. Start the app with PM2: `pm2 start npm --name "dfitness" -- run start`
11. Set PM2 to restart on server reboot: `pm2 startup` and `pm2 save`

**Optional but Recommended (Secure Custom Domain):**
1. Buy a domain name (e.g., `admin.dfitness.com`).
2. Point the domain's A-record to the VPS's public IP address.
3. Install Nginx.
4. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic from port 80 to port 3000.
5. Install Certbot to get a free SSL certificate automatically so your app runs on `https://`.

**How to Use:**
- Go to `http://[Your-VPS-Public-IP]:3000` or your custom domain name (e.g., `https://admin.dfitness.com`) from any device, anywhere.
